  Kobe Bryant died January 26, 2020 at age 41 in a helicopter crash, along with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and 7 other passengers.

  Bryant retired from basketball in 2016 as the NBA's third all-time leading scorer and won 5 NBA titles during his 20-year career.
  His $680 million in earnings from playing salary and endorsements during his playing career were a record for a team athlete.
